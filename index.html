    <h1>Visualizing connections between scientific publications using networks and embeddings</h1>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p> This project addresses a situation where students wish to research a new scientific subject by collecting a well-informed list of scientific articles to read through a Google Scholar query. 
      The problem with such a query is that Google Scholar search results are simple and linear, preventing the student from comparing results across content metrics or discovering contextual relations between papers. This means that the students must select papers to read based on less information and considering, potentially reducing the quality and effectiveness of their research. 
      Conversely, since research is the first step in learning a new subject, improving this process could quickly improve a student’s interest and understanding of a novel subject matter. This tool aid in such research by presenting the results of a Google Scholar search in both a network and scatterplot embedding. The resulting visuals can be filtered and adjusted based on user preference. Also, papers can be selected to reveal further information such as Authors and Abstract, which can expedite the process of selecting papers for further review.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> This tool visualizes information about the search results of a specific Google Scholar query (in the case of our example visual, the query is “epigenetic profiling in single cells”). This included the title, abstract, number of citations, number of authors, year of publication, venue, and more. Importantly, each paper also has a list of papers that cite it, which is pivotal to creating the citation network visualization. The ordinal and categorical metrics are visualized on a scatterplot, with adjustable axes based on user selection. 
      The data was scraped from the Google Scholar webpage using ScholarlyAPI and ScaperAPI. Web scraping is a complicated ethical issue, since most websites do not encourage automatic scraping efforts. We tried to mitigate traffic concerns by using the ScraperAPI, which incorporated automated delays on each query.
      The data is significantly biased towards Google Scholar’s search algorithm, since we scrape the top 200 search results from that webpage alone. In terms of data quality, some of the venues of publication, such as Nature, have extraneous symbols and characters added to the end of their titles, which need to be removed to show the real name. Also, the page count is in a string format and sometimes includes letters or dashes, so these values need to be removed and cast into integers in order to calculate the page length.
